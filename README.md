# TerraSwitch
PowerShell script that facilitates the action of switching Terraform versions on the fly.

## Usage
```
Options are as follows:
  -Version : The version of Terraform to be installed.
          - The list of versions that are able to be used can be derived from the '-ListVersions' option below.

  -ListVersions : List all versions of Terraform available for installation.

  -Latest : Automatic installation of the latest version of Terraform. 
```
### Examples
```
PS C:\Users> TerraSwitch.ps1 -Version 0.12.5

#### Disclaimer
This was heavily influenced by [TFswitch/Terraform-Switcher](https://github.com/warrensbox/terraform-switcher).  
Due to it not being natively compatible with PowerShell, I decided to create this instead.
